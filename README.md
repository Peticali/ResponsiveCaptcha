# ResponsiveCaptcha

hCaptcha will resize according to the width of the father element, good for mobile web apps.
May work with recaptcha (need to change class name)

How it works? with transform: scale() and some negative margins calculations

Add to your HTML:

    <script src="ResponsiveCaptcha.js"></script>
